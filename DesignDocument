Testing Strategy:

1st: Testing SQL Statements- 
For each option in the database we created a SQL statement and ran it through to SQL until desired results were acheived.

2nd: Testing python- 
For the each option we created a seperate python file that connected to the database and ran the sql statement through python. We were able run and debug each option till it gave the desired results.

3nd: Testing python-
Combined each option to our main python program. Where through our selected role we ran each option from our main program that called selected functions.



bugs- Null vs None in python
    - can't import Nurse from Nurse (have to import Nurse then run Nurse.Nurse)
    - 








Extra Decisions:

added feature to run Sql Statements
instead of classes we had function that open the database and run the its designated query against it.
